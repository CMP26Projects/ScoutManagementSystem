## Why do you have to use this website?

This website is based on a well structured database and a user friendly app, which helps in providing the best managerial experience to the scout captains. It helps them in:

### Scout management

- Getting Scouts' absence and statistics over a certain interval
- Sending automatic notifications in case of exceeding the limit of absence
- Adding/removing them from/to any sector

### Sectors management

- Adding/removing new sectors from/to the system
- Managing leading captains
- Managing Absence for each sector's leading captains

### Activities and sessions

- Saving each activity including it's type, place and time
- Grading scouts on the activities they joined and showing stats

### Finance management

- Adding weekly subscriptions
- Adding incomes and expenses to the system
- Getting updated value of the total balance and each transaction has been done

### Stats

- Viewing attendance stats for scouts and captains
- Providing graphs for better analysis
- Getting reports on the current system status
